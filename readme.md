LifeLog is a life tracker app for Android that uses NFC technology to keep track of whatever one so chooses. LifeLog offers features such as goal setting for your trackers, time stamp history of your trackers, personal customization options for your tracker, and more. Opposed to other similar apps, LifeLog allows you to log your daily habits by simply putting your phone in the vicinity of an NFC chip while in the app.
